Travel Management System
The Travel Management System is a C++ project developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It provides a platform for users to book tickets for travel to various destinations, manage their bookings, and view travel records.

The system includes the following features:

Ticket Booking: Users can book tickets for travel to different cities and countries.
Dynamic Pricing: Ticket prices are calculated based on factors such as the class of travel and the time of booking.
Cancellation: Users have the option to cancel their bookings, with a reduction in price to half.
File Storage: All booking records are stored in files, ensuring data persistence and easy retrieval.
